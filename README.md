# SQL.RU-parser
get_pages_sqlru.py. Returns a list of all pages from SQL.RU forums that contain topics of the given author and contain given search string. Unlike built-in SQL.RU search, It returns a separate line for every page, not for every topic. It its move convenient because a topic can contain hundreeds of pages and only one of them contains the information required.
The list is returned in CSV format and contains topic names and page URLs.
